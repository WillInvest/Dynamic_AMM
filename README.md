# Generalized Automated Market Maker (AMM) Simulation

Welcome to the Generalized Automated Market Maker (AMM) Simulation repository! This Python project is designed to simulate the behavior of a generalized automated market maker, a crucial component of decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. This simulation encompasses various modules such as AMM core functionality, fee structure implementation, solver algorithms, and utility functions to provide a comprehensive understanding of how AMMs operate.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hanlonlab/AMM-Python
   ```

2. Install the required packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

<!-- ## Project Structure

- `amm.py`: Contains the core logic for the Automated Market Maker.
- `fee_structure.py`: Implements the fee structure for trades within the AMM.
- `solver.py`: Provides algorithms for solving equations and optimizing AMM parameters.
- `utility_functions.py`: Includes utility functions used throughout the project. -->

## Usage

Check ```main.py```
<!-- To use the AMM simulation, import the necessary modules in your Python script and create instances of the AMM, fee structure, solver, and utility functions as needed. You can then simulate various scenarios and analyze the behavior of the AMM under different conditions.

```python
from amm import AMM
from fee_structure import FeeStructure
from solver import Solver
from utility_functions import UtilityFunctions

# Create instances of AMM, FeeStructure, Solver, and UtilityFunctions
amm_instance = AMM()
fee_structure_instance = FeeStructure()
solver_instance = Solver()
utility_functions_instance = UtilityFunctions()

# Simulate AMM behavior and analyze results
# ... (add your simulation code here)

# Example: Simulate a trade and calculate resulting balances
trade_amount = 100  # Amount of tokens to be traded
input_token_balance = 1000  # Initial balance of input token in the AMM
output_token_balance = 500  # Initial balance of output token in the AMM
trade_fee = 0.01  # Trade fee percentage

# Perform a trade using the AMM
output_amount = amm_instance.trade(input_token_balance, output_token_balance, trade_amount, trade_fee)

# Print the resulting output amount after the trade
print(f"Output amount after trade: {output_amount}")
``` -->
